# React Gallery

Time: 18 hr. sprint/weekend.

## Instruction
We were tasked with making a gallery, using React, that would be interactive.

##### Base Mode:
- *App* component, *Gallery List* component, *Gallery Item* component
- Like button and likes display
- Description that would be shown, on click, with conditional rendering
- Using axios to transport data server-side.

##### "Stretch Goals":
- Using Git branching throughout assignment
- Utilize database
- Add form component with functionality
- Delete button
- Utilizing Material-UI in our styling.

### Wireframes:

## Construction
After spending a week learning React, about states and functional programming, about components, props and data flow, I felt relatively comfortable creating the foundation for my app in React. Creating my own mental model to understand the data helped concretize the more abstract concepts of the week. 

#### Challenges
- Handling branching, merging and merge conflicts, without deleting important code
- Mouse events (spent some time learning, but want to understand more)
- CSS, specifically when using a library

#### Future Changes
Mouse events in React were new to me this weekend, I would love to learn more about them and how to get my conditional features working smoothly. 

I would love to learn how to add a feature for users to crop their own images, to keep both resolution and aspect ratio without warping the image.

I spent some time trying out responsive layout for the first time. I would like to learn more, to expedite the process.
